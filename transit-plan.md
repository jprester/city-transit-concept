# Transit Plan for Zagreb 2050 Visualization

The app models two speculative build-out options and exposes them through the plan switcher and timeline slider. Costs reflect the narrative used in the UI.

## Plan Summaries

- Realistic: Premetro + Metro Line A spine + Sava Skyway. Cost: €3–4.5B over 2025–2050.
- Ambitious: Full three-line metro (A/B/C) + Premetro + Sava Skyway + Medvednica Skyway. Cost: €8–12B over ~25 years.

## Realistic Timeline (drives in-app visibility)

- 2025 Present: Planning only; no segments visible.
- 2030 Early Phase: Premetro west segment under construction; development zones start.
- 2035 Mid Phase: Premetro complete; Metro A south phase opens; Sava Skyway west section starts.
- 2040 Advanced: Metro A reaches airport; gondola fully active.
- 2045 Mature: Metro A north extension opens; development zones active.
- 2050 Complete: Metro A fully built to Sesvete; premetro + gondola fully live.

## Ambitious Timeline (plan switcher → Ambitious)

- 2025 Present: Network design only.
- 2030 Phase 1: Premetro construction + Metro A south under way.
- 2035 Phase 2: Metro A complete; Metro B east opens; gondola west section active.
- 2040 Phase 3: Metro B complete; gondola fully active; Medvednica Skyway lower segment begins.
- 2045 Phase 4: Metro C east segment opens; Medvednica Skyway reaches Sljeme; development zones active.
- 2050 Complete: Metro C west built; both skyways and all lines A/B/C operational.

## How the App Uses This

- The timeline slider filters segments, stations, and development zones per phase.
- Medvednica Skyway appears only when the Ambitious plan is selected and relevant years are chosen.
- Station markers and labels are automatically limited to the active segments for the selected plan/year.
