# Plan For Zagreb transit network 2050 visualization

## Vision Overview

The speculative Zagreb 2050 transit plan.

Currently envisions:

### Premetro (Underground Tram)

Central tunnel network handling most tram lines through the core
Surface running on outer branches
Relatively affordable, leverages existing system

#### Light Metro (One Line)

The northeast-southwest corridor (Sesvete → Airport) as true grade-separated rapid transit
Serves the longest-distance trips that even premetro can't handle efficiently
Fully automated, higher capacity

#### Gondola

Sava Skyway as discussed—scenic, tourism-oriented, connecting the riverfront

### Upgraded Surface Tram

Lines that don't use the tunnel get full signal priority and dedicated lanes
New vehicles throughout

This hybrid approach might cost €2-3 billion total over 20 years—substantial but achievable—rather than the €8-12 billion for a full three-line metro network.

The Political Appeal
Premetro has a political advantage: it's easier to build incrementally and show results.

Year 1-3: Announce project, complete design, begin construction on first tunnel segment
Year 4-6: First underground station opens (Jelačić), immediate improvement visible
Year 7-10: Full central tunnel operational
Year 10+: Extensions as funding allows

Each phase delivers tangible benefits. Voters see progress within a single electoral term. Compare this to a full metro where you spend a decade digging before anything opens.

Potential Drawbacks
Capacity Ceiling
Premetro is inherently limited by tram vehicle size. If Zagreb's population grew substantially or mode shift to transit was dramatic, you might hit capacity constraints that full metro wouldn't face. But given Zagreb's demographic reality (stagnant population), this is probably acceptable.
Conversion Complexity
If you later want to convert premetro to full metro (as Brussels partially did), it's expensive and disruptive. You're somewhat locked into the tram-scale infrastructure.
Mixed Operations
Running trams in tunnels alongside surface operations requires careful scheduling and creates some operational complexity. Not insurmountable, but needs good management.

My Assessment
For Zagreb specifically, premetro makes a lot of sense. The city is:

Not large enough to justify multiple full metro lines
Already has an extensive tram network worth preserving
Constrained financially (Croatia's economy limits megaproject capacity)
Suffering primarily from central congestion, not system-wide capacity shortage

The premetro approach addresses the actual problem (slow central speeds) without over-building for a demand that may never materialize.
If I were revising the speculative plan, I'd probably propose:

Premetro: Central tunnel network (€1-1.5 billion)
One light metro line: Sesvete-Airport corridor (€1.5-2 billion)
Gondola: Sava Skyway (€200-300 million)
Surface improvements: Signal priority, new vehicles, better stops (€300-500 million)

Total: €3-4.5 billion over 20 years—ambitious but not fantastical.
